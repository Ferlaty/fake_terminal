# Fake Terminal
A fake terminal simulating dir /s command and a pop up message saying: "Unauthorised access detected!". Makes the user scared, since it tries to simulate an unauthorised access to their system. This is complitely harmless, since it is running in a browser (you can check the code :)) Great for pranking friends, family members...
